%To summarize, in this paper, we described the method to compensate for the computational errors that are introduced when running the MD code in FPGA or GPU using approximate computing technique.  
We conclude by noting that the present method have been recently implemented in the universal force engine i-Pi \cite{iPi}, which can be generally applied to all sorts of forces affected by stochastic noise such as those computed by GPUs or other hardware accelerators \cite{HOOMD, NAMD, OpenMM, HalMD, Lammps, Amber, Gromacs}, and potentially even quantum computing devices \cite{Steane, Knill, Blatt, Chow}. The possibility to apply similar ideas to N-body simulations \cite{White, Makino} is to be underlined and will be presented elsewhere.
